# JSP Programming Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java Server Pages (JSP) projects developed with Servlet connections, integrated with **Apache Tomcat**. These projects demonstrate various functionalities in web applications using **JSP** and **Servlets** for backend logic.

## Contents

1. **Cookie**: 
   - Demonstrates how to create and manage cookies in a web application.

2. **Database JDBC**:
   - Implements JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to perform database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

3. **Employee Login Data**:
   - A user authentication system that validates employee credentials from a database.

4. **Customer and Loans**:
   - Manages customer information and their loan records.

5. **Maths Operations**:
   - Contains basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., implemented in JSP.

6. **Maths RMI**:
   - Demonstrates Remote Method Invocation (RMI) for performing mathematical operations across a network.

7. **Servlet**:
   - Core servlet examples to demonstrate server-side handling of requests and responses.

8. **Session Tracking**:
   - Implements session tracking using both Cookies and HttpSession to manage user states across multiple requests.
